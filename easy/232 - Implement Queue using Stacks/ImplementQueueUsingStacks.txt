https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/

Problem:
  Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).

  Implement the MyQueue class:

  void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
  int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
  int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.
  boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.
  Notes:

  You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
  Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.
 
Examples:
  Example 1:
  Input
  ["MyQueue", "push", "push", "peek", "pop", "empty"]
  [[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
  Output
  [null, null, null, 1, 1, false]
  Explanation
  MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
  myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
  myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
  myQueue.peek(); // return 1
  myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
  myQueue.empty(); // return false
 

Constraints:
  1 <= x <= 9
  At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, peek, and empty.
  All the calls to pop and peek are valid.

Pattern(s): Stack

Parameter(s):

Algorithm:
  Private attributes: push Stack and pop Stack

  Constructor: Initialize push and pop stacks

  void push(int x):
    Push x to push stack

  int pop():
    If the pop Stack is empty, convert the push stack to pop stack by repeatedly pushing elements of push stack to pop stack

    Return popStack.pop()

  int peek():
    If the pop Stack is empty, convert the push stack to pop stack by repeatedly pushing elements of push stack to pop stack

    Return popStack.peek()

  boolean empty():
    If both Stacks are empty, return true

    Return false if we get here

Code:
  class MyQueue {
      private Stack<Integer> pushStack;
      private Stack<Integer> popStack;
      
      public MyQueue() {
          pushStack = new Stack<>();
          popStack = new Stack<>();
      }
      
      public void push(int x) {
          pushStack.push(x);
      }
      
      private void convertPushStackToPopStack() {
          int pushSize = pushStack.size();
          
          for (int i = 0; i < pushSize; i++) {
              popStack.push(pushStack.pop());
          }
      }
      
      public int pop() {
          if (popStack.isEmpty()) convertPushStackToPopStack();
          
          return popStack.pop();
      }
      
      public int peek() {
          if (popStack.isEmpty()) convertPushStackToPopStack();
          
          return popStack.peek();
      }
      
      public boolean empty() {
          if (pushStack.isEmpty() && popStack.isEmpty()) return true;
          
          return false;
      }
  }

Complexity Analysis:
  Time: 
    push(): O(1)
    pop(): Amortized - O(1), Worst - O(n)
    peek(): Amortized - O(1), Worst - O(n)
    empty(): O(1)
